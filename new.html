    <p>Mika Salamanca is true to her words. While she was inside the Bahay ni Kuya as one of the housemates of “Pinoy Big Brother: Celebrity Collab Edition,” Mika promised to donate her prize money if she were to become the big winner. Heaven must have heard her, because Mika and her partner, Brent Manalo, were named Big Winner Duo and bagged P1M each. Mika kept her promise. She donated her entire cash prize to Duyan ni Maria, an orphanage in Mabalacat City, Pampanga, that provides shelter and care for abandoned and neglected children. “I really wanted to give back to the people. It’s not in my list to be a big winner. And since the day I stepped inside, I promised myself, kung manalo, I want to give the winnings back to the people who put me here,” said Mika, who earned the reputation as the “big winner with a big heart.”<p></p>

<p>MANILA, Philippines — Lady Gaga and Sabrina Carpenter may be competing for three of the top Grammy Awards next year, but their fellow pop artists are making sure the competition is interesting all around. Joining Gaga and Sabrina in the Record and Song of the Year race is "Apt.," the hit track by Blackpink member Rose and Filipino-American singer-songwriter Bruno Mars. It makes Rose the first solo K-pop singer ever nominated for a Grammy, as past Korean nominees were groups BTS, some of its members for Album of the Year credits, and classical artists. The Fil-Am artist won his 16th Grammy last year when he and Gaga's collaboration "Die With A Smile" won Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. "Apt." is in that hotly contested category this year as it even features tracks from popular musical films — "Defying Gravity" from "Wicked" and "Golden" from "KPop Demon Hunters." Fans of the latter movie will be happy to see "Golden" also in the Song of the Year race and the likely leader in for Best Song Written for Visual Media, while David Guetta's remix of the song is up for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical. "Golden" is performed in the film by fictional girl group Huntr/x, featuring the singing voices of Ejae, Audrey Nuna, Rei Ami.</p>

 <h1>IV of Spades officially back with 2nd album 'Andalucia'</h1>
 <h4 style="color: gray;">Kristofer Purnell - Philstar.com November 6, 2025 | 8:00am</h4><br>
<center><video src="IV OF SPADES - Aura (Official Music Video) (1).mp4" controls width="700" type="mp4"></video><br></center><br>
<p>It was short-lived with the departure of vocalist Unique Salonga in the same year to pursue a solo career. The remainig members, Badjao de Castro, Blaster Silonga, and Zild Benitez, were left to oversee the release of their debut album "ClapClapClap!" in 2019. The 15-track album spawned the singles "In My Prison," "Bata, Dahan-Dahan," "Take That Man," "Bawat Kaluluwa," and "Come Inside of My Heart," as well as the songs "Sweet Shadow," "Not My Energy," "Dulo ng Hangganan," "My Juliana," "I'm a Butterfly," "I Ain't Perfect," and "Captivated." The three remaining members released two more singles — "Ang Pinagmulan" and "Sariling Multo (Sa Panaginip)" — in 2020 before announcing an indefinite hiatus. Filipino music fans were very much surprised when IV of Spades released the song "Aura" last July with Salonga back in the picture. Another surprise single, "Nanaman," followed in August with the confirmation of a second studio album. To promote its release, the band also dropped "Konsensya" and "Suliranin." The album, "Andalucia," fully reunites the band members who have matured over the years and rediscovered the friendship and unity between them.</p>
